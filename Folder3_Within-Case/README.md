# Add Grid3 data
To run the code, you will need to download the GRID3 shapefiles for each country. Store them in the following format inside each of the country folder: 
grid3_COUNTRYCODE
For example, for Angola, name the folder that contains the Grid3 shapefiles as follows: ‘grid3_AGO’; 
then store it inside the ‘AGO’ subfolder.
